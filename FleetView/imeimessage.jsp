	                     As per Govt. of India's requirements, any mobile device that does not show valid IMEI number has to be barred with effect from  21 Dec 09. This provision does not allow for or provide for legally procured devices when the IMEI number is not picked up by  the cellular operator's switch.<br>
	     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	
	                We anticipate some disruption of data transmission till this issue is resolved. Transworld is working with Airtel in order to correct the reading issues. There are no problems with devices running on Idea and Vodafone networks.<br>
	     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	
	      Please bear with us while we tackle this situation that has arisen due to circumstances beyond  our control.
